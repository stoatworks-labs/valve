/**
    An off-screen buffer for one stage of the chain.

    Three things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO.

    **It reallocates only when it has to.** Ensure() is called every frame and
    is a no-op in the overwhelming majority of them. Nothing in this plugin
    carries state across frames -- a valve chain is memoryless -- so a
    reallocation that clears loses nothing.

    **It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
    deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
    `depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
    so the colour texture is leaked on every release (SDK b1afaf9,
    `FFGLFBO.cpp`). `Destroy()` deletes it first.

    **It owns its filtering.** Every buffer here is a table read texel for
    texel with `texelFetch` and interpolated by hand in float, because a
    texture unit's bilinear weights carry as few as eight fractional bits on
    some hardware -- a table read through one is quantised before the shader
    sees it. So every buffer here is Nearest. Linear and Mipmapped are
    tinsel's and are unused.

    Copied from tinsel by way of clamp; the mechanism is unchanged.
