/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    A small member of the fleet's `diag` family. The rest of the repos get a
    rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an FFGL effect gets
    only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- an effect is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    What it covers are the two failures that actually happen.

    **A shader that will not compile.** `InitGL` returns `FF_FAIL` and from
    the operator's side that looks like "the effect does nothing", with no
    message anywhere; with two passes this also records *which* one, which is
    the difference between a five-minute fix and an afternoon. The GL vendor
    and version strings go in next to it, because a shader that compiles on one
    machine and not on another is a driver answer, not a source answer.

    **A buffer that could not be allocated.** This plugin holds one table of
    stage curves and one small table of chroma responses; neither depends on
    the picture's size, so this is rare. What goes in the log is which buffer
    and the size asked for, because the failure mode when the driver says no
    is a picture that simply never changes.
